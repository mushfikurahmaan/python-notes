## Matplotlib and its key applications.

Matplotlib is a popular Python library used for creating visualizations, such as line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and more. It's widely used because it provides a simple way to visualize data, making it easier to understand patterns, trends, and insights.
So now we will walk through all the topics of matplolib and I'll try to keep things simple.

## Installation.
To start with matplotlib we need to install it. We can install it by typing the following command in terminal. Be sure to update pip before installing matplotlib, it's optional but recomended for best practices.
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
```
# For Linux and Mac
python3 -m pip install matplotlib
```
```
# For Windows
python -m pip install matplotlib
```

## Creating our first chart.

For using matplotlib we've to import matplotlib in our code editor e.g Visual Studio Code/Sublime Text/Atom/Jupyter Notebook.


```
# Importing matplotlib
From matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```
```
#  Or we can also write 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
